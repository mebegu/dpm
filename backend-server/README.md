# Audio Processing Server

## Introduction

This project implements a REST API for handling audio files, including uploading, processing, and retrieving the status of audio files. The API supports recording audio, sending it for processing, and retrieving the processed results.

## Features

- **Upload Audio File:** Receives an audio file along with the userâ€™s email address.
- **Process Audio File:** Queues the audio file for asynchronous processing.
- **Check Processing Status:** Retrieves the status of audio processing jobs.
- **[Not Implemented] Download Processed Audio:** Allows users to download the processed audio file.

## Assumptions

- Each audio file is processed asynchronously, and the final result can be retrieved once processing is complete.
- The system uses S3 (mocked) for storing audio files and uses an in-memory SQLite database for tracking processing statuses.
